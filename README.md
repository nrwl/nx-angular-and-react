# Building Angular and React Applications Together With Nx

Large companies often use multiple frontend frameworks to build their products. One product can be built with Angular, another one with React. These products, even though are built by different teams using different stacks, often share components and utilities.

Setting this up traditionally is challenging. Companies put a lot of effort in making sure teams can collaborate and use each other's work. Nx drastically simplifies this.

This repository has two applications (one in Angular, and one in React) that will use a library of shared web components.
